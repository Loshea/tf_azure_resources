# Diagnostic Settings
This module creates a diagnostic settings configuration to be attached to applicable resources.  This module is intended to be a sub-module to various resources.   The module allows for the configuration of one or more end points for diagnostic data: event hub, analytics workspace, storage account, or other partner solutions.

# Architecture Diagram
Eventually, I will include a diagram of the created architecture.
