# VNET
This module provisions a virtual network, it's associated SubNets, and optional Bastion Host and Virtual Network Gateway.  This module does NOT provision Network Security Groups at this time.  See the NSG module for Network Security Groups.  Diagnostic Settings can also be configured during creation of the VNet infrastructure, provided the targeted diagnostic data end-point exists.  All resources will be created in the resource group specified for the virtual network.

# Architecture Diagram
Eventually, I will include a diagram of the created architecture.
